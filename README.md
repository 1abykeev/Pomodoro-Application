## Description

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. This technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This Pomodoro Timer application allows users to:
- Start a work session of 25 minutes
- Take short breaks of 5 minutes between work sessions
- Take a long break of 20 minutes after completing 4 work sessions
- Reset the timer at any point

## Features

- **Dynamic Timer**: The timer dynamically switches between work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
- **Visual Feedback**: Users receive visual feedback in the form of tick marks for completed work sessions.
- **Simple UI**: The user interface is clean and easy to use, built using Tkinter for Python GUI development.
